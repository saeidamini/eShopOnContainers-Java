# eShopOnContainers Java Rewrite

Hey folks! This project is my attempt to rewrite the awesome [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/) demo app using Java and Spring Boot instead of .NET.

The goal is to showcase best practices for architecting containerized microservices apps in the Java world.

## Project Scope

Here's what we'll be building over the next 8 weeks:

### Week 1
- [ ] Scaffold the initial Spring Boot microservices
- [ ] Implement user registration and login
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines

### Week 2
- [ ] Complete identity management and account services
- [ ] Containerize services using Docker

### Week 3
- [ ] Build product catalog and inventory services
- [ ] Add product search and browsing

### Week 4
- [ ] Develop shopping cart microservice
- [ ] Enable adding products to cart

### Week 5
- [ ] Implement ordering and payment services
- [ ] Add checkout workflow

### Week 6
- [ ] Complete order placement flows
- [ ] Add order confirmation logic

### Week 7
- [ ] Incorporate resiliency patterns
- [ ] Implement monitoring

### Week 8
- [ ] Enhance logging and tracing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security reviews
- [ ] Bug fixes and final touches

By the end, we'll have a production-ready implementation of core ecommerce microservices using cutting-edge technologies.

And the best part is the app will be open source! So you can use it as a reference for your own microservices journey.

Let's do this! ðŸš€

## Technologies
Here are the awesome technologies we'll use:

-  Java 17+
-  Spring Boot
-  Spring Cloud (Netflix stack)
-  Docker
-  Kubernetes
-  Kafka
-  Elasticsearch
-  Grafana

Microservices, containers, events - we're going all in!
